# regression_house_price
Regression model to predict house price.<br>
Hi, I am creating this minor project to get familiar with GitHub. Untill now I have made small coding projects locally like handtracking, face recognition, game scripts etc mostly using Python and C++.<br>
I will be using Google Colab Notebook for the Python coding part along with TensorFlow Library to build the said Regression model. I will choose a dataset from Kaggle which I will link here for reference (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)<br>
# The goal is to make the regression model on my own with litle to no help form the sources. <br>
<br>
# regression_house_price_v2
Making the previous made model more accessable and more accurate by introduction of standardisation and normalisation to the process.<br>
Using SKLearn Library for the standardisation and noramlisation process.<br>
Note : No changes in the model parameters will be made in order to compare the previously made version.<br>
For more information please check the patch notes that will be added at hte end of the v2 project.
