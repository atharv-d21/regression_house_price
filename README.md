# House Price Prediction Using Regression Model
<br>
To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
<br>
How do we predict house prices ?
<br>
1. We analyse and preprocess the training data and test data to feed in to our model. <br>
2. For preprocessing, we replace null values with 0 which will indicate missing values instead of empty null strings which can not be interpreted by the model.<br>
3. Further in preprocessing, we eliminate redundant columns which will not contribute the house price pridiction.<br>
4. Now, we convert the entire data into numeric form which will be readable by our model.<br>
<br>
A regression model works by establishing a mathematical relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable,<br>
allowing you to predict the value of the dependent variable based on known values of the independent variables. <br>
Essentially, it finds a "best fit" line through data points to understand how changes in the independent variables influence the dependent variable, enabling predictions based on this relationship.
