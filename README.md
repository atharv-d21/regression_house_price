# House Price Prediction Using Regression Model
<br>
<i>Enter the aim of project.</i>
<br>
How do we predict house prices ?
<br>
1. We analyse and preprocess the training data and test data to feed in to our model. <br>
2. For preprocessing, we replace null values with 0 which will indicate missing values instead of empty null strings which can not be interpreted by the model.<br>
3. Further in preprocessing, we eliminate redundant columns which will not contribute the house price pridiction.<br>
4. Now, we convert the entire data into numeric form which will be readable by our model.<br>
<br>
<i>Explain the working of regression model.</i>
