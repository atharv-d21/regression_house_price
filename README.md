# regression_house_price
Regression model to predict house price.<br>
Hi, I am creating this minor project to get familiar with GitHub. Untill now I have made small coding projects locally like handtracking, face recognition, game scripts etc mostly using Python and C++.<br>
I will be using Google Colab Notebook for the Python coding part along with TensorFlow Library to build the said Regression model. I will choose a dataset from Kaggle which I will link here for reference (ADD LINK TO KAGGLE DATASET HERE, currently undecided)<br>
# The goal is to make the regression model on my own with litle to no help form the sources.
